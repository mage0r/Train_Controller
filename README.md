DC Hbridge Model Train Controller
=============

This project is to build a Model train controller.

This is a DC motor controller and as a result is only really suitable for trains that are on completely independent tracks.

There are three sections, a dxf with the box design, an arduino sketch with some awful code in it (that fortunately at least includes some acceleration effects) and lastly a few photos of it in action.

The arduino I used is a (http://www.freetronics.com/collections/arduino/products/eleven "Freetronics Eleven")

I also used a (http://www.freetronics.com/collections/shields/products/hbridge-dual-channel-h-bridge-motor-driver-shield "Freetronics Dual Channel H-Bridge motor shield") and a (http://www.freetronics.com/collections/modules/products/poe-power-regulator-28v "Freetronics PoE power regulator")
